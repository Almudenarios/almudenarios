# Hello there, I am **Almu** 👋. 

I am currently completing my Final Project before graduating from **King Juan Carlos University's degree on Videogame Design and Development**: a full Demo developed on Unity for a Cozy Game about STEM Disciplines ⚙🌱🧪💾

Over the course of my education there I have learnt to work using different languages - **C++, C#, C, Java, Javascript, and Python** - within different programming paradigms out of which **Object Oriented Programming was prevalent**. I have learnt to work with both Relational and NoSQL Databases. 

I have good organizational skills and can work both under a cascading strategy or an agile work methodology such as SCRUM. 

You can find me here:
